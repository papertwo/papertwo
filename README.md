# Hey, I'm Xianwen Wang 🚀

*Control Engineer by day, Code Alchemist by night ☕*

### 🎓 **Academic Chronicles**  
- **M.Sc. in Control Engineering** @ Beijing Institute of Technology *(2023–2026)*  
  - Thesis: *“How to Make Robots Stop Bickering: A Guide to Swarm Harmony”* (working title).  
- **B.Eng. in Automation** @ Harbin Engineering University *(2019–2023)*  
  - Minored in *“Surviving Group Projects”* (A+).

### 🛠️ **Toolbox of Chaos**  
**Languages**: Python (🐍), C/C++ (👴), C# (🕹️), MATLAB (📉)  
**Frameworks**: PyTorch (🔥), Transformer (🤖), Unity (🎮)  
**Tools I Can’t Live Without**: Git (😅), Conda (🐍), Coffee (☕)  
**Secret Weapons**:  
- CET-6 English *(520/710 – I can read papers faster than you can say “gradient explosion”)*  
- Mandarin *(Native – 100% fluent in sarcasm and technical jargon)*

### 🔭 **Currently Conquering the Matrix**  
- Teaching cars to predict the future (aka **Transformer-based trajectory forecasting**) so they don’t play bumper cars on highways.  
- Building a **Unity drone swarm simulator** where UAVs learn to dance in sync (spoiler: their choreography is better than mine).  

### 🌱 **Brain Currently Absorbing**  
- How to make robots gossip better with **Reinforcement Learning** (it’s all about that multi-agent small talk).  
- Trying to outsmart time itself with **non-autoregressive decoding** (because waiting for predictions one step at a time is *so* 2023).  

### 👯 **Collab Dreams**  
- Open-source projects where robots write their own fanfiction.  
- Anything involving **autonomous systems**, **swarm intelligence**, or coffee-powered hackathons.  

### 🤔 **Help Needed**  
- Scaling my drone rave party to 10,000 units without crashing Unity (or my laptop).  
- Explaining to my graduate advisor what "hardware-in-the-loop testing" means (I’ve tried puppets. It didn’t work).  

### 💬 **Ask Me About**  
- Why MATLAB and C# are frenemies (hint: it’s a love-hate relationship with semicolons).  
- How to survive grad school: *Step 1: Buy a lifetime supply of bubble tea. Step 2: See Step 1.*  

### 😄 **Pronouns**  
He/Him/*“Why is my code not compiling?!”*  

### ⚡ **Fun(ky) Facts**  
- Once translated a **MATLAB algorithm to C#** in uncountable hours. The secret? 7 cups of bubble tea and sheer denial of sleep.  
- My hobbies include arguing with gradient descent and convincing my plants they’re part of a control system.

### 🚀 **Projects That (Mostly) Didn’t Explode**  
#### [Autonomous Traffic Oracle](https://github.com/your-link)  
- Built a **Transformer-powered crystal ball** to predict vehicle trajectories.  
- Successfully convinced cars that lane-changing without signaling is *not* a personality trait.  

#### [Drone Swarm Simulator: Electric Boogaloo](https://github.com/your-link)  
- Taught drones to cha-cha in Unity *(3D visualization included, no disco lights… yet)*.  
- Turned MATLAB control logic into C# code *(and lived to tell the tale)*.  

#### [Missile Guidance: The Tinder Edition](https://github.com/your-link)  
- Engineered algorithms to make missiles “swipe right” on targets.  
- Stability analysis? More like *“Why won’t you behave?!”*  

---

### 🏆 **Trophy Wall**  
- **National Math Competition**: 1st Prize *(2021)*, 2nd Prize *(2020 – blame the coffee shortage)*  
- **Scholarships**: Grad school edition *(Beijing Institute of Tech)* + undergrad trilogy *(Harbin Engineering)*  
- **Patents**: Co-invented 2 methods to make robots/missiles play nice *(1 approved, 1 pending – patent office speedrun any%?)*  

---


**Let’s connect! I’m always down for:**  
- 🧪 Wild experiments in autonomous systems  
- ☕ Coffee-fueled coding sprints  
- 🤖 Debating whether Skynet would use PyTorch or TensorFlow  

*“Code hard, debug harder”* – Probably Confucius, idk 🤷♂️  

### Behold! My glow-up saga: From 'Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V' apprentice to 'I swear this code worked yesterday' wizard 🧙♂️
